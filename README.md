## Hi, I'm Gerard Keiser

I design, write, and maintain full-stack applications, using legacy GWT, hot new TypeScript libraries, and some stuff in between.

You can see my pinned repos below, check out [my portfolio site](https://gerardkeiser.com), or take a look at [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/gerard-keiser). Or my Urbit id is `~talsym-norsud`, if you're into that sort of thing.

🌱 Currently learning: Kotlin, NixOS, and how to tame Java.

⏳ Learning next: Hoon, Ktor, and Svelte

⚡ I love static typing, immutability, and graph databases.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to blockchain or education.

💬 Ask me about Latin participles. (I taught it for seven years.)

:smirk: btw I use an Arch-based distro
