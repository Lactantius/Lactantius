🌱 Currently learning: blockchain technologies and functional techniques.

⏳ Learning next: C#, serverless deployment, and different database types.

⚡ I love static typing and graph databases.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to blockchain or education.

💬 Ask me about Latin participles. (I taught it for seven years.)
